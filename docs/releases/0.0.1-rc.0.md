### Reliable detection of version `draft` generated by the `release-bot`
Fix the detection of generated versions by querying the local sqlite database. Before, it was trying to detect it parsing the output of the `generate` command, which was a very fragile detection mechanism that was in fact not working well and only applied if no prefix was applied.
See https://github.com/sequentech/release-bot/issues/1 for details.
